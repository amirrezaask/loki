# Goals
A language to fix my problems.<br>
I use Go mainly but I want to be able to write programs for other spaces if I need like games or low level things like OS.
My problems with Go:<br>
- err handling sucks
- no low level access for when I need it
- generics sucks
- reflection sucks
- type system sucks:
	- no enum/unions
