Refactor

1. Lexer, produces tokens
2. Parser, produces AST1 (AST1 is untyped and not checked at all AST).
3. Type Inference, produces AST2 (AST2 is typed and type checked).
4. Semantic Analyzer, produces byte_code (byte_code is a set of instructions).
5. Target Code generator (generate code for a target, now probably only CPP).
