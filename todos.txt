- test suite


- initializers should just generate code to set each field seperately
- no need for explicit void in function def

- binary and bitwise operators 

- defer
    *each function that have a defer usage, will have a label at the end (with a guard) so when user does return we first jump to defer run the instructions and then we come back and return.

- dynamic array

- variadic args

- slicing arrays

- enums should not depend on host language, they should just be normal constants.

- unions

- file load scoping

- generics

- memory stuff
