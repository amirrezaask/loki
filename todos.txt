------ refactoring ------
- ast type checker errors should be stacked as possible.
- finish error-system branch
- initializers should just generate code to set each field seperately ( now cpp backend handles ordering because of cpp wierd initializers)



----- Features -----
- type casting using `as` keyword
- defer
  *each function that have a defer usage, will have a label at the end (with a guard) so when user does return we first jump to defer run the instructions and then we come back and return.
- LLVM
- unions
- generics: take a look into generics.loki.notyet
- dynamic array:
  - strings should be our own dynamic array impl. 
  - variadic args
  - slicing arrays
  - converting a dynamic array into c variadic array.
- load files into a namespace
- memory stuff
