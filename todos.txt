----- Features -----
- module path env variable, paths that compiler search for file loads.
- dynamic array:
  - strings should be our own dynamic array impl. 
  - variadic args
  - slicing arrays
  - converting a dynamic array into c variadic array.

- unions
- type casting using `as` keyword
- defer
    *each function that have a defer usage, will have a label at the end (with a guard) so when user does return we first jump to defer run the instructions and then we come back and return.

- LLVM
------ refactoring ------
- finish error-system branch
- initializers should just generate code to set each field seperately ( now cpp backend handles ordering because of cpp wierd initializers)
- enums should not depend on host language, they should just be normal constants.
------ Future ------
- load files into a namespace
- generics
- memory stuff
