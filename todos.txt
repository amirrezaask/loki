------
- make dynamic array work through void pointers
- transform array initialize into decl + array pushes.
- trasnform ForIn => while
- transform For => while
- type casting using `as` keyword
- defer
  *each function that have a defer usage, will have a label at the end (with a guard) so when user does return we first jump to defer run the instructions and then we come back and return.
- unions
- generics: take a look into generics.loki.notyet
- using a block will put all it's decls into current block scope.
- ast type checker errors should be stacked as possible.
- LLVM
- dynamic array:
  - strings should be our own dynamic array impl. 
  - variadic args
  - slicing arrays
  - converting a dynamic array into c variadic array.
- load files into a namespace
- memory stuff
