------
- transform array initialize into decl + array pushes.
- trasnform ForIn => while
- transform For => while
- defer
  *each function that have a defer usage, will have a label at the end (with a guard) so when user does return we first jump to defer run the instructions and then we come back and return.
- tuple data type
- unions
- generics: take a look into generics.loki.notyet
- using a block will put all it's decls into current block scope.
- ast type checker errors should be stacked as possible.
- scope/body is just another statement, parser should handle this so we can have nice things like:
  ```
  if true something;
  if false somthing else somethingelse;
  ```
- LLVM
- dynamic array:
  - strings should be our own dynamic array impl. 
  - variadic args
  - slicing arrays
  - converting a dynamic array into c variadic array.
- load files into a namespace
- memory stuff
