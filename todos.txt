- initializers should just generate code to set each field seperately

- no need for explicit void in function def

- binary and bitwise operators 

- arrays:
  - dynamic array
  - strings should be our own dynamicarray impl. 
  - variadic args
  - slicing arrays

- defer
    *each function that have a defer usage, will have a label at the end (with a guard) so when user does return we first jump to defer run the instructions and then we come back and return.

- enums should not depend on host language, they should just be normal constants.

- unions

- load files into a namespace

- generics

- memory stuff
