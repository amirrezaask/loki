# Loki

Loki is an experimental programming language that I am building both to learn more about compilers and test ideas about language design.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirrezaask/loki.git
cd loki
cargo install --path .
# if you have added cargo bins inside your path you can use loki command.
```

## Features so far

- functions
- control flows ( if , for , foreach, while )
- loading libraries
- type inference / type check
- loading C headers and using them
- CPP codegen
